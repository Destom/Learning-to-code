attack surface,a part of the SW / OS /network  visible to an attack
BCP (business continuity Plan),Plan to maintain business if the main site goes down this is different from a DRP because a DRP assumes that the system has gone down

Grey-box testing,some information of system before pen testing
GRUB,Boot option and configuration tool designed for Linux (grub 2 exists)
Hack Value,Higher value then average target  (domain controller for example)
HAL (Hardware abstraction layer),windows tool to  use multiple different pieces of hardware (E.G. different graphics cards) to do the same job depending what is installed
HDD (Hard disk drive),
Hot Site,"The top option as far as disaster sites go. This site typically has a high degree of capabilities like real time network synchronisation, to the point where it duplicates the primary site completely."
HSRP (Hot standby router protocol),
HW (hardware),
IDE (internal development environment),
Init (Initialization),the father of all processes
IPS (intrusion prevention systems),
IRP (incidence response policies),
IRT (Incidence response team),

MITM ( Man in the middle),
NIC (network interface card),
NIST (national Institute of Standards and technology),
NSE (Nmap Scripting Environment),View page 
NTFS (NT (new technology)file system),
OSI (open systems interconnection),Networking model
Passive recon,Indistinguishable from normal traffic
PID(process ID),number assigned to processes running on the processor
Pivot point,Compromise device  and pivot it's  connections to reach more targets
PnP (Plug and Play),
POST (power on self-test),Part of the boot process to make sure all HW is still functional before continuing boot
 Powershell,The new version of CMD
Putty,SSH & telnet tool
ransomware,Encrypts data and tells the user to pay to unlock (not always unlocked)
RAT (Remote Access Trojan),
Repeater,
script-kiddie,you know… like Mike
SLA (service level agreement),
Social engineering,gaining information by communicating with a person
Spider,Travels the web catching metadata
SSH (Secure Shell),"The basics ""Setup in Linux"""
SSHstrip,Used with mitm attacks it converts https sites into http sites so that there is no warning pop up on the victims computer
Statefull remembering,Remembers state of information going in one direction to allow return information
STP (Spanning tree protocol), tool used to determine who forwards information I a paralel network (BID = bridge id) also uses reply time (cost)
suicide hacker,someone who hacks without trying to conceal their identity
SW (Software),
Syntactic sugar,When a coding language provides a shorthand for the user to make coding simpler
TOE (Target of Evaluation),system or resource being targeted for vulnerabilities
Traceroute,shows the hops required to reach a website
TTL(Time to live),
VHDD (virtual Hard Disk drive),
VLAN (Virtual local area network),
VPN (Virtual private network),
vulnerability,any weakness in a network or OS
WAN (Wide area Network),
Warm site,Middle of the road option for Disaster reCovery providing some equipment and minimal infrastructure saving time for restoration in the case of an emergency but still needing some lead time
White hat hacker,ethical hacker working inside the rules
White-box testing,Fully aware of the environment (normally an employee)
